I have developed some computation tools for geoscientific research, such as tools for joint inversion of Love and Rayleigh waves for crustal radial anisotropy, joint inversion of Rayleigh wave ellipticity, phase velocity and receiver functions for high-resolution crustal structures and tools for corrections of seismic sensor misorientation and off-great-circle travel effects. The related softwares will be released soon in this website, or you can contact me for personal use at present (aisanxi14@mails.ucas.ac.cn).
