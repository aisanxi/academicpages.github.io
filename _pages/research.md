# Waiting for updated.

I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). My primary research interests lie in understanding the dynamics and deformation of the Earth's interior (mainly the crustal and uppermost mantle) through various geophysical observations, such as ambient noise of the Earth, seismic signals. Specifically, by studying the seismic velocity, velocity anisotropy, and time-varying seismic velocities employing a series of geophysical techniques, I have constructed some high-resolution seismi models of tectonic active regions in east China. Together with geochemical and geologic observations, those seismic images provided important clues on lithospheric deformation and dynamics.

In addition, I have developed some computation tools for geoscientific research, such as tools for joint inversion of Love and Rayleigh waves for crustal radial anisotropy, joint inversion of Rayleigh wave ellipticity, phase velocity and receiver functions for high-resolution crustal structures and tools for corrections of seismic sensor misorientation and off-great-circle travel effects. The related softwares will be released soon in this website, or you can contact me for personal use at present (aisanxi14@mails.ucas.ac.cn).

To better undertand the Earth (a kind of system-oriented Natural Sciences), I'm open to all kinds of skills taken from other disciplines, such as deep learning, frequency-time analysis, Monte-Carlo method, parallel computation...
